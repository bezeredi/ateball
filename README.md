Building ateball
----------------

Before attempting to build the project, perform the following:

	mkdir bin obj

as this will make the directories for the binary executable, ateball, and the
object file directory for compiled object files. Afterwhich, it is safe to
build the program using:

	make

This will build the program and place it in the bin directory. There is not
currently a way to automatically install the program onto the user's system.
This will come later once autoconf is employed over the software.
